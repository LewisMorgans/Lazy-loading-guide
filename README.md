# LazyLoading in Angular TypeScript

An example of using Lazy Loading within the Angular 2 framework current version 9.

Lazy loading is a concept where we delay the loading of classes (components) and their required modules until it is needed. By seperation we cut down our load times by not loading all bundles at once; only loading what we need, when it is needed.
